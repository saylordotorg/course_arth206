-   **Unit 1: Early Renaissance: The Proto-Renaissance**  

    *In mid- to late-thirteenth century Italy, elements of a new
    understanding of representation began to emerge within Christian
    art. Though many medieval conventions survived into the fourteenth
    century, and the “International Gothic Style,” a decorative and
    “two-dimensional” form of representation, was in vogue, some artists
    began to incorporate their observations of physical reality and
    ancient Greek and Roman art into their work. The term
    “Proto-Renaissance” refers to this artistic period spanning the
    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in Italy. In this unit, we will
    first study the social and historical context that served as a
    backdrop to these developments as well as the medieval artistic
    traditions within which these changes took place. We will then
    explore the transformations that took place in the art of the
    Italian fourteenth century.*
