-   **Unit 3: The High and Late Renaissance**  

    *At the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century and the beginning of the
    16<sup>th</sup> century, three Italian artists epitomized the
    achievements of Renaissance art: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo,
    and Raphael. In Venice, a distinctive style of painting,
    recognizable by its emphasis on soft, hazy effects and a strong
    interest in light and color, developed. Art created later in the
    century in the style of the Renaissance and High Renaissance is
    referred to as late Renaissance art. In painting and sculpture, some
    of its characteristics include harmonious and balanced compositions
    or structures, a clear sense of space, and an interest in natural
    settings, the human anatomy, and human psychology. The major
    characteristics of architecture from this period include:
    centralized plans, simple geometric shapes, regularity of design,
    and styles borrowed from Classical Antiquity. *

        artists that was written in the 16<sup>th</sup> century through
        the eyes of Giorgio Vasari. It is a revealing document on the
        artists studied themselves, as well as on the changing role of
        the artist in society and the values by which they were judged
        in sixteenth century Italy. Try to get a sense of the life of an
        artist during the Renaissance as well as the values that govern
        Vasari’s depiction of the artists.
