In this course, we will focus on becoming “literate” in the art of the
Italian Renaissance, on identifying the effects that the Renaissance had
on the arts of Italy, and discovering the ways in which specific
historical developments impacted those arts from the end of the
thirteenth century to the end of the sixteenth century. The Renaissance,
a European phenomenon that began to develop in the late thirteenth
century, refers to a marked shift in the ways in which individuals
perceived their world. A new outlook was emerging—one that was
characterized by, among other things, increased humanism and a renewed
interest in the cultures of Classical Antiquity (and all within a
Christian framework). There is no specific date that marks the beginning
of the Renaissance, but its burgeoning effects on art can be detected
earlier in Italy than in other areas. The late thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries in Italy are consequently referred to as the
“Proto-Renaissance” and will constitute our first unit of study. In a
dramatic departure from the art of their time, early Renaissance
artists, such as Giotto, began to represent humanized saints that had
real corporeality and visual mass. In the “quattrocento,” or Italian
fifteenth century, the ideas of the Renaissance developed more
fully—first in Florence, and later throughout the region. These ideals
and developments, which included the use of mathematical systems to
represent illusionistic space, the integration of models from Classical
Antiquity, and an interest in the human body, are reflected in
fifteenth-century art, the subject of our second unit of study. Then, in
the early sixteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and
Raphael (the powerful forces behind what is known as “High Renaissance”
art) mastered their media and respective techniques and fully achieved a
correspondence between Renaissance ideals and art.  Their styles were
borrowed and adapted throughout the century. Mannerist art, the subject
of our last unit of study, began to develop in the second quarter of the
sixteenth century. Mannerism represents a response to the harmonious and
structured compositions of the High Renaissance; many of its prominent
artists created artworks that both used and violated Renaissance
artistic ideals.

### Course Information

Welcome to ARTH 206. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** Elisabeth Miller

**Primary Resources:** This course draws from a wide variety of free
online resources. The following resources are among those we will be
using the most frequently throughout the entirety of the course:

-   Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker’s online textbook,
    [Smarthistory.org](http://smarthistory.org/)
-   The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s [“Heilbrunn Timeline of Art
    History”](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itar/hd_itar.htm)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit of the outline. You will then need
to pass the Final Exam with a score of 70% or higher. If you do not pass
the exam, you may take it again. The four units are mostly comprised of
readings, lectures, and videos. 

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately 76 hours
to complete. The time advisories listed under each unit title will help
you organize your calendar. Units are sometimes unequal in the time
investment they require on your part so you may want to take a look at
the time advisories for each unit before you begin the course.

**Tips/Suggestions:** In addition to reading the material, listening to
the lectures, and watching the videos, you will need to take careful
notes and spend time reviewing to be able to pass the Final Exam.  This
course will require you to understand the important characteristics of
the different periods of Italian Renaissance art and the forces that
helped shape them, but it will also demand that you remember individual
artists, their styles, and their artworks. The learning outcomes and
instructional boxes accompanying the links to the course resources will
help you focus your study.
