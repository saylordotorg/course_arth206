-   **Unit 4: Mannerism**  

    *In this final unit, we will study Mannerism, a style of art that
    emerged during the late Renaissance and—though much influenced by
    the Renaissance Masters—violated Renaissance ideals. This style
    replaced the clarity, ideal proportion, rationality, and nature of
    High Renaissance art with ambiguity of content and form, distortion,
    and artifice.  *

         Instructions: Please read the “Introductory Note” to this
        important autobiography written by one of the most significant
        representatives of the Mannerist style in Italian art. Note that
        Cellini’s work was one of the first autobiographies in the
        Renaissance, which would tend to reinforce Peter Levine’s view
        of Mannerism as a result of the increasing importance of the
        artist’s subjectivity. Please read “Section I” of the book.
        Then, read or skim through other sections at will, taking notes
        on how the author describes his and other artists'

         Instructions: Listen to this lecture in its entirety (about 13
        minutes). In this video, Dr. David Dorgin and Dr. Beth Harris
        discuss a Mannerist sculpture by Benvenutto Cellini, the artist
        that wrote the autobiography from which you read in the
        introduction to this unit. As well as noting the specifics on
        the context of the commission of the work and its iconography,
        make sure to remember in what ways mannerism can take effect in
        the media of sculpture.
